# Noodel

A language dedicated to code golfing ASCII Art and Animation. The current version of _Noodel_ does not handle string manipulation
very well. So, I am going to attempt to redefine the language with more of an actual design. Just as some notes, I would like to
incorporate the language _Charcoal_ which does a fantistic job at turtle like ASCII art, but does not handle animations very well.
_Noodel_ did well with animations, but if there was a complicated string of any sort it would fail.
